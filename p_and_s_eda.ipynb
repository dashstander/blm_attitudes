I media used Black Lives Matter a disorganized hashtag parading as a civil rights movement because of the word *Black* in the title. There have been groups talking about police brutality in inner city communities for decades not until one with a simple name and a race specifically in the title do they choose to talk about it.

If you want to be dense to even the data you linked to then that's your choice. Blacks are an easy target and are grouped in large bunches. To bust white kids they would have to go to less dense areas. Also the small towns they live in have in general a much lesser police presence and budget. &nl;&nl;Black kids get caught&com; get a felony&com; go deeper within the system. Get out with nothing but a stamp that says you can't get a normal job that makes money&com; the most lucrative positions obtainable then are positions moving drugs. Which since it's a business that's illegal offers no protection for lost funds or theft outside of your own hands. It's easy to see. Barely anyone is saying blatantly \"I want to target blacks\" it's just how the system has been. A lot of blacks started getting criminal records for ridiculous accusations after the civil war so the slave labor could continue in the form of chain gangs&com; this continued and then even more got charges during the civil rights movement. This entire time being a direct target by police&com; after that came mandatory minimums and the war on drugs&com; which made cheaper less pure versions of the drugs that poor people used carry much harsher sentences. This entire time since the cops have been at literal war with blacks since the civil war &com; and money was hard to come boy since most opportunities were not available. It allowed gangs to grow. The problem is deep&com; police brutality is a problem&com; BLM is stupid in the fact they don't acknowledge it is an American problem&com; as whites are very much affected too. Thus splitting police brutality into a black v white issue&com; couple this with the fact this group has no charter or real leaders and anyone with a hashtag or that's black within 10 miles of the protest is considered in the group. It gives the media an easy way to damage race relations&com; there have been groups protesting police brutality for years&com; doing this for years.

Black people are a statistical minority in America and Europe. Having spaces specifically for Black people helps for discussions that are by for and about them and their issues and/or culture.&nl;&nl;On the other hand&com; white people are the majority (or at least plurality) in most of America/Europe. It’s not necessary for them to make white only groups because their ideas and culture are already part of the mainstream&com; and on average&com; they also have more economic and and political power.&nl;&nl;On the issue of double standards: the reason why things like “White Power/Pride” send off red flags is because in addition to not being a statistical minority nor a historically oppressed group&com; “White” isn’t even a race—it only exists in relation to being Black or colored. The only reason Black people refer to themselves as Black is because descendants of slaves lost all connection to their specific nationality and ancestry. &nl;&nl;A more fair comparison would be if there was a sub specifically dedicated to Irish or Italian culture and on certain posts tried to limit the posters to people who are actually from their or have direct ancestry—and if that were the case&com; I wouldn’t consider that racist either.\n"

      "My biggest problem with having this conversation at all is how people's overexcitement of Kendrick often leads to a total disregard for the history of hip-hop and all the artists that came before him. Like if you think Kendrick is the GOAT. You're absolutely entitled to that opinion man. TPAB is a classic. And I will never stop praising it. &nl;&nl;But there are so many things worth considering such as the people who came before Kendrick as well as the people who are more talented than Kendrick but never got their shine due to whatever circumstance. They deserve equal praise as well because they had to deal with far more intolerant and aggressive scrutiny within the genre as it was still growing. People like NWA&com; Lauryn Hill&com; Outkast&com; Jay Z&com; Kanye pretty much defined what hip-hop is today&com; breaking conventions and influencing both the genre and people's perception of it. &nl;&nl;Back then it was virtually impossible to win a AOTY Grammy let alone get some radio play without some bubblegum pop song that appeals to wider demographics. People consider Outkast's Speakerboxxx one of their weaker projects&com; and it won AOTY almost entirely thanks to a lot of the artistic concessions that they made. &nl;&nl;How many hip hop artists today get ripped apart by the media which in turn completely harms any chances of them becoming mainstream household names? You think it was unfair how Taylor Swift won AOTY over TPAB? Welcome to being a hip-hop fan because that's pretty much what every hip-hop artist has had to deal with for the last 40 years.&nl;&nl;But now today&com; hip-hop is pretty much a mainstream hit that everybody and their grandparents wants a piece of. That combined with the crazy internet age&com; FOX News&com; Black Lives Matter. Kendrick has positioned himself at the perfect time as the new official hip-hop golden boy to show audiences how gangsta rap can be taken seriously as a critical art form.&nl;&nl;And he deserves every ounce of praise he gets because he is truly a phenomenal artist.&nl;&nl;But I will NEVER in good conscious call Kendrick the GOAT because not only did he not get where he is on his own but he certainly hasn't been around long to enact the same amount of genre defining influence as his predecessors. The greatest in the last 5 years? Arguably. But of all time?&nl; Never. Nonetheless&com; I have high expectations for him and look forward to everything he does.\n",

At first glance&com; one may think this is a protest song because he spends the vast majority of it criticizing white people and whiteness for instilling self-hatred and portraying hatred upon the black community but he flips the script at the end of the song when he realizes that despite all the animosity he holds towards the white community for vilifying him&com; he's still a hypocrite because he has been a destructive force in his own community just as much as white people.&nl;&nl;The song is a great song in the context of the album&com; and for Kendrick's own battle with internalized racism&com; his own hypocrisy&com; and navigating his voice within the community but that song is in no way relevant to what's going on since George Floyd (or any pro-black sentiment either). Depending on interpretation&com; this song is either a criticism of himself or the black community as a whole. I chose to believe the former&com; because otherwise the song serves as an antithesis to the point of the album (at least in my opinion). But either way&com; if we analyze the song as a whole and take into account the final verse&com; this song **is in no way a protest song** unless the protest is against the black community (which seems to *not* be the point of this thread).\n",

      "Are you assuming i’m not black? lol&nl;&nl;Alright had more that a moment. Have you gone to any BLM rally in the past 4 years? That song is literally a chant they do to rally people together. TPAB is the encapsulation of a very ever-present contemporary black experience. Of course&com; it’s not gonna resonate with everyone in our community because our experience isn’t homogenous but as an artistic portrait&com; it does a good job&com; especially for it to become as popular as it did. Art is subjective so of course people are gonna consider some things boring but I think we can take an objective look on how that album has impacted the culture. In a world of modern hip hop&com; Kendricks dropped a best selling conscious album  with imaginative jazz-rap production. He rapped about being kunta in a white mans world&com; feeling alright despite police brutality&com; recognizing his hypocrisy in his own social justice versus personal demons&com; loving himself and not committing suicide because of the way his life has gone. The album situates itself as not only a depiction of a black experience (as said before) but also within a contemporary white mans world and a society that invalidates such a story being told. NO other mainstream artist had the balls to go on the Grammy stage in chains singing that we&com; as a black community&com; are going to be alright. That album is politically ambitious&com; artistically creative&com; and above all&com; an encapsulation of this decade. No other popular rapper has done what Kendrick has in that album this decade.\n",
      "popheads\n",
      "I’m not gonna disagree when you say how artistically ambitious the album is but let’s not forget how culturally relevant TPAB was in the context of the decade it’s was released in. He talks about mental health and suicide&com; the plight of the black man and social justice seamlessly through jazzy hip hop. And the fact that such a sonically experimental (or at the very least non-mainstream sounding hip hop record) could enter the popular space of music is phenomenal. Kendrick experimented with different styles too but - as said - what also matters is the grand impact it has had on the culture. That album will remain one of the most celebrated politically charged records to date because it was impactful. “Alright” is the anthem for the black lives matter movement&com; a historically significant enough movement that will be talked about for years to come. I’m not denying that MBDTF was an artistic masterpiece but Kendrick made an album that was not only an artistic masterpiece in its own right but also an album that perfectly encapsulates some of  the biggest political discussions of the decade.\n",

      "&gt;Both slogans are not controversial in the strict definition of the words&nl;&nl;Not really lol. &nl;&nl;Black Lives Matter is a statement that literally means and implies that black lives are not being considered as valuable in this country. This is evidenced by the years of oppression we've suffered&com; police brutality&com; the prison industrial complex&com; the judicial system&com; and the list goes on and on. What's controversial about that? But the statement \"Make America Great Again\" implies that America was \"great\" at one point in time. But great for whom? Since when has it been universally accepted as a great place to live? Because immigrants&com; minorities&com; members of the lgbtqia+ community&com; women&com; and many more groups would disagree that it ever was a truly great place to live for everyone.&nl;&nl;\"Black Lives Matter\" is only \"controversial\" because racist white folk erroneously took the term to mean that we're saying non-black lives don't matter and even if you consider the wrong protests done by people in the name of the organization&com; that doesn't change the fact that the simple phrase is simply just meant to bring attention to the fact that this country doesn't value us. &nl;&nl;It's incorrect to equate both phrases as equally controversial (or even that BLM is controversial) and imply that they are opposites. One promotes advocacy on behalf of a group of disenfranchised and oppressed people. And the other makes a hopeful proclimation based upon a whitewashed and misinformed summation of American history. \n",

      "The government goes to great lengths to hide these kind of things. In most of Europe&com; it is illegal to even categorize crime stats by demographics. In the US you can still find them though they are still not reliable as in the case annual [FBI crime stats&com;](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/tables/table-43) the reports include stats from many departments and agencies that do not report on demographics. I mean&com; one needs only look at crime stats to see why blacks are more likely to have encounters with police and be incarcerated. They are 15% of the population but commit 30% of the crime... People try to explain this away by saying crime stats are void b/c if police are racist they will be targeting blacks anyway but you can look at the annual [dept of Justice crime victimization surveys](http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&amp;iid=245) - which includes stats consisting of victims reporting on the race of their attackers&com; and the truth becomes clear.&nl;&nl;Denying these things is the primary problem of this whole cultural Marxist Black Lives Matter agenda that refuses to acknowledge basic group differences (human biology) and behaviors&com; choosing instead to blame everything on \"white racism\" - i mean what an anti-intellectual position. No&com; there are REAL biological and epigenetic factors as to why blacks have disproportionate outcomes in society. I wont really get into those here but if you are interested&com; just read a behavioral genetics or evolutionary biology textbook. The primary correlation to societal outcomes however&com; is IQ. Consequently&com; blacks in the US have an average IQ of around 85 - which is literally in the sweet spot for those that have a high propensity for violence. (please understand that im not making a normative claim here - that is to say&com; a moral judgment - I am simply stating a positive fact.)&nl;&nl;But yeah&com; as part of the egalitarian agenda&com; there is alot of suppression of these troublesome realities and others. There are always cries of racism when groups dont have completely equal outcomes. PRO-TIP: ppl are not equal. Different groups&com; on average&com; are better at different things. Human beings are not blank slates molded by their environments. Everyone cant be an astrophysicist if only certain social conditions are met. Ultimately though&com; the burden of proof is on those accusing \"racism.\" You can find hundreds of supposed studies saying police are racist b/c blacks have higher arrest rates - but as already stated&com; yes those that commit more crimes get arrested/charged more. &nl;&nl;Like i said&com; b/c of the suppression of this type of information&com; it is notoriously hard to find objective studies on this type of stuff - especially since the obama administration. One thing that is often cited is disproportionate traffic stops&com; [but studies show](http://www.nij.gov/topics/law-enforcement/legitimacy/pages/traffic-stops.aspx)&com; again&com; blacks are more likely to violate traffic laws. Another thing often brought up is the drug war&com; with many saying that blacks and whites use drugs at the same rate but are disproportionately charged. This primarily can be attributed to the fact that blacks are&com; again&com; more likely to commit other crimes - and are charged with more drug offenses as a biproduct. There are also studies that shows blacks are more dishonest when self-reporting drug use and are more likely to use harsher substances. [Page containing links to sources](http://www.amren.com/archives/videos/race-and-drug-arrests-another-big-lie/) &nl;&nl;Another thing that is brought up is disproportionate sentencing with ppl saying blacks are sentenced more harshly for the same crimes. This can be easily explained by something these \"studies\" often leave out however: past criminal history. If you have committed more crimes in your past&com; you will receive a longer sentence. In fact&com; when comparing cases between blacks and whites involving the same crime and circumstances&com; when criminal history is roughly the same&com; a very different picture emerges. Also&com; something to consider is money - if you are relying on a public defender&com; as compared to someone who can afford a high priced attorney&com; you are probably going to get more time.&nl;&nl;Obviously racism and racist cops exist... but as to how much it actually explains in terms of the criminal justice system is marginal at best. There are also things to consider within this conversation like single-motherhood - the number one predictor of criminality. As early as the 40s and 50s&com; blacks had stronger families than whites and in some age demographics (teens and young adults)&com; they had [lower unemployment rates.](http://www.ncpa.org/pdfs/st112.pdf) So&com; are we to expect that ppl have gotten MORE racist since WW2? No&com; obviously thats absurd. The destruction of the black family which led to a dramatic increase in black crime and the drastic increase in black unemployment has one primary culprit: the welfare state. &nl;&nl;This type of egalitarian notion that blacks are in the position that they are in b/c \"white racism\" is ridiculous. No&com; there are ACTUAL factors at play. Primarily&com; biological disparities in intelligence and wefareism. The echoes of \"white privilege\" being promoted within the context of Black Lives Matter and the rest of the social justice warrior nonsense is A POLITICAL TACTIC - it is cultural Marxism - the promotion of more and more socialism on the basis of replacing traditional class enemies like \"capital owners&com; the bourgeois\" etc. with \"white heterosexual cis-gendered males.\" Political correctness is a communist tactic - the creation of a new proletariat with so-called \"victim groups\" to take on the perceived enemy of \"capitalism.\" If thats your bag&com; whatever support what you want&com; but many ppl in the police accountability movement have no idea what they are supporting when it comes to things like this.\n"

      "&gt; While that article is very interesting and a good read&com; the origin of police isn't all that relevant here. The history of the police and how they got started in different areas&com; really has nothing to do with the fact that today&com; the world is a different place and the reason we need police today is different. The police may have started as an answer for crowds and not crime&com; but the reason we have police today is very much for crime. Crowds too of course&com; but also crime.&nl;&nl;I disagree.  The police do not&com; in practice&com; actually prevent crimes&com; and we could probably debate all day how much of the institution&com; if any&com; is necessary to solve them.  There have been experiments that show decreasing or even removing police patrols has absolutely no effect on crime rates&com; even in high-crime neighborhoods.&nl;&nl;&gt; Today&com; and in this country&com; the police are here to serve and protect.  It's their motto.&nl;&nl;It's their *slogan*.  It's PR.  Actions speak a *hell* of a lot louder than words.&nl;&nl;&gt; They are here to keep people safe&com; first and foremost.&nl;&nl;That's their *supposed* justification.  It's what everyone has bought as the reason they are here.  But it just doesn't pan out in practice.  Taxes are evil; cops are great heroes; everything that looks like communism&com; socialism&com; and labor protection is built to steal your stuff; immigrants and poor people are free-loaders; etc.  We're piled *miles high* with propaganda that's been shoved down our throats for decades&com; at the least.  Much of it is diametrically opposite from reality.&nl;&nl;EDIT: Forgot to add the main thing I wanted to say: the history and origins of the institution are *extremely* relevant.  Looking at their behavior today&com; in light of the purpose of the institution&com; sheds a whole new light on it.  It highlights the *reason* for their violence&com; and why the whole system (the state) condones and excuses it rather than punishing it.  It gives you the background to understand why they approach protests for movements like Occupy Wallstreet and Black Lives Matters the way they do.  Please don't be too dismissive here.  We're far too quick in the U.S. to allow important history to become obscured&com; whitewashed&com; or simply ignored.

      "My point was that it is possible for people who claim to like \"small government\" to support that sort of very aggressive policing specifically because \"small government\" is one of those racist dogwhistles that is there to let the audience know that the politician supporting it favors policies that will disproportionately hurt black people.  &nl;&nl;It has very little to do with actual small government.  Just as \"law and order\" has very little to do with actual law and order.&nl;&nl;Republicans saying they support small government while actively supporting policies that increase policing (mostly of black and brown people) is the generally unspoken true meaning of that phrase.&nl;&nl;I'm not sure I actually know anyone&com; outside a few internet libertarians who I'm rather dubious about&com; who genuinely supports shrinking the government in general just on principle. Mostly you encounter people who dislike specific areas of government activity and describe reducing those specific areas (often while growing the areas they like) as \"small government\".&nl;&nl;The left has at least a tiny shred more honesty in discussions of government size in that it at least discusses cutting the parts of the government they dislike as cutting the parts of the government they dislike rather than hiding those specific programs under the general slogan of small government.&nl;&nl;I'd also find the whole obsessive focus on federal vs. state government by some people to be bizarre&com; if that weren't also one of the standard and classic examples of racist dogwhistle politics.  \"State's rights\" has pretty much always been used as the rallying cry of people opposed to individual rights for minorities.&nl;&nl;Note&com; for example&com; the (not so) subtle way Reagan kicked off his first presidential campaign: he delivered an impassioned speech defending \"state's rights\" at the site of a massacre of civil rights workers.  The location was very much not coincidental&com; Reagan's message to the voters was basically the same as Trump's (ie: black and brown people are evil scumvermin and I'll take every opportunity to oppress them that exists)&com; he just didn't say it quite so openly and instead relied on broad hints.&nl;&nl;So yeah&com; you hear a lot of stuff that seems contradictory if you don't know the long history of disguising racism in other&com; more acceptable&com; language.  That quote from Atwater is still telling about a lot of political talking&com; especially from Republicans but also from Democrats.

The people who made a circus out of Eric Garner's death which was unfortunate but could have been completely avoided if he had just complied with the arrest instead of resisting and then when he was taken down by about 6 cops because he was so large dies of heart failure from the physical struggle that his body couldn't handle. That 'choke hold' lasted barely a second or two and people pointing to that are just full of shit. The reality is that his body shut down because it couldn't handle the physical stress of resisting arrest. Sad&com; but totally avoidable just like MB.  &nl;&nl;The reason they are calling to boycott him is that he was publicly backing a group with little to no credibility in terms of presenting their cases truthfully&com; they routinely bad mouth all cops regardless of whether you've been accused of abuse/murder or not and they certainly have cop hating assholes who call for all cops to be killed in their midst. &nl;&nl;So am I surprised that Police unions are against someone who supports the jokers thatmake up BLM?

      "9:00 a.m. – 10:45 a.m. &nl;Breakfast/Closing Plenary&nl;Higher Education in the Wake of the  &nl;Ferguson Movement&nl;N. Hemisphere BCD &nl;From #blacklivesmatter&com; to #notonemore&com; we are experiencing &nl;a resurgence of the civil rights movement. But as we see &nl;tens of thousands of people marching in the streets&com; how is &nl;this movement being played out on our college campuses? &nl;What role does higher education play in the current social &nl;justice movement? How are campuses creating environments &nl;supportive of diverse movements&com; voices&com; students and faculty? &nl;Are higher education institutions cultivating their student &nl;activists? If so&com; then how are those student activists being &nl;cultivated in these potential organizing cultural environments?&nl; &nl;http://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/program_higheredconf15.pdf  &nl;21. Opening speakers at the assembly included past NEA president Mary Hatwood Futrell&com; one of the union's most beloved leaders&com; now the top officer of Education International&com; the result of the merger of the international bodies of NEA and AFT in 1993--a harbinger of the 1998 proposal. Futrell made it simple. \"I saw the light. Merger is for the children. Albert Shanker and I hugged one another. Now we have clout in a united organization with the IMF and the World Bank. My friends&com; and I call you my friends because you are&com; the children need us . . . tomorrow you will vote on the kind of America you want children to have. Vote for unity with your heart.\"&nl;&nl;  A student NEA leader from Illinois said&com; \"The pressures and tactics being used to whip members into line threaten the integrity of the organization. We wouldn't give up our democracy if we were just voting internally. Why should we do that with a merger?\" Mary Washington&com; the African-American president of the Louisiana NEA&com; stated&com; \"We fear our beliefs are being diminished. We have been led to believe that an independent NEA is a good thing&com; that the little guy should have a right to democratic participation . . . this set of principles makes a mockery of our core beliefs. This is unacceptable&com; unacceptable&com; unacceptable!\"&nl;&nl;     24. Bob Gilchris ran for the national executive committee solely on a \"No to Merger\" platform. He got 45% of the vote. His \"it's simple&com; vote no!\" drew loud applause.&nl;&nl;     25. Illinois' Haisman said&com; \"We reject this document only after careful analysis. We are willing to work with the AFT&com; but we don't want to become the AFT. We don't know the details of the agreement&com; but details help preserve our rights&com; our democracy. This flawed document will not help us focus on education. It creates a top-down structure that reduces our key leaders to spectators.\"&nl;&nl;     &nl;&nl;     28. . \"Look&com; I would have stuck to what I think are the facts. Unity with the AFT makes sense for these reasons: we are under attack from an organized right-wing movement that wants to de-fund public education. We need to be together. We have bargained about this with the AFT for more than five years. We got some. They got some. We can live with this agreement. We can do it now because the time is ripe. Why wait? Some states are about to merge anyway. Why isolate them? We have locals that are already merged&com; and they are here supporting the merger. They have experience with this. Who else does? The AFL is the AFL. Good and bad&com; not the big bad wolf. Our leaders can easily hold their own with them&com; if they have to. I wish I could have talked. This is a shame. Honest people on both sides are set up as crooks.\"&nl;&nl;     29. Silence from some quarters was interpreted as a powerful message. A Florida delegate said&com; \"Bob Chase's campaign manager for his presidency was one of the most prominent African-American leaders in the NEA. She was also ex-president Geiger's campaign manager. When she talks&com; we all listen. She hasn't said a thing.\"&nl;&nl;     30. Executive Director Don Cameron&com; originally a teacher from Michigan&com; compared opposition to the merger to opposition to the American Revolution. Cameron then invoked the legendary Dr. Seuss who lent his name to the \"Read Across America\" literacy projects. Young NEA members flooded the floor distributing tall red and white stovepipe Dr. Seuss hats. The nearly 10&com;000 delegates to the NEA assembly&com; casting the most significant ballots in the last forty years of the labor movement&com; voted wearing the accouterments of the beloved Dr. Seuss. While they voted&com; NEA showed a promotional film on universal human rights on huge screens stationed around the auditorium. When the film came to a group of children praising the secret ballot&com; the Illinois delegation broke into raucous cheers.&nl;&nl;     31. Even before they arrived&com; delegates were deluged with pro-merger material: a personal letter from Chase&com; a series of pro-merger articles and ads in the prestigious Education Week newspaper&com; support from professors who linked the merger to Chase's \"new unionism&com;\" visits to most states from top NEA leaders. In late January 1998&com; Executive Director Cameron circulated a letter threatening staff who were not on board with the program&com; \"There is no room on the boat of new unionism and new culture for old culture stowaways. You can ride&com; but you can't hide.\" And in May he said&com; \"NEA is NOT neutral on this issue. Therefore&com; neither is NEA staff. NEA strongly supports&com; and is actively advocating for&com; the approval of the Principles of Unity by the delegates to the 1998 NEA Representative assembly. So&com; therefore&com; is the staff.\" This form of direction to staff is unusual inside the NEA Family. Nevertheless&com; staff opposition to the merger was often vocal. Staff members&com; usually former teachers&com; raised many of the same objections that came from the rank and file&com; and they added their own concerns about their wages and pensions should an affiliation with the AFL proceed.&nl;&nl;     32. More than 40 percent of the delegates were attending their first or second NEA assembly. The line-up of pro-merger past presidents meant nothing to them. One young delegate referred to the renowned Futrell as \"that woman from some Educational International; what's up with that?\" Pro-merger leaders were provided with lists of first-time delegates and told to contact them&com; one-to-one&com; in their hotel rooms before the vote. The room lists were often incorrect&com; the new delegates gone&com; out on the town. Most last-minute contacts were never made.&nl;&nl;     33. Before the vote&com; people very intimate with Chase and Van Roekel predicted they would lose&com; 55-45&com; an estimate remarkably close to the actual vote. The press reported the massive rebuff as a stunning defeat. The New York Times ran the coverage at the top of the front page. Chase was reported as appearing shocked in a press conference immediately following the vote&com; although he smiled on stage when the vote was announced.&nl;&nl;     34. It is hard to believe the leaders were shocked. While state presidents surely mis-estimated their ability to deliver (the president from Florida assured Chase a 90% yes vote&com; while my survey of that delegation indicated a no vote of around at least 35%)&com; the Wall Street Journal and Education Week had reported an uphill climb for the merger supporters&com; with a state-by-state analysis. Moreover&com; Chase's home state of Connecticut openly voted against the merger prior to the convention&com; as did Weaver's home state of Illinois. Michigan&com; which has produced so many NEA leaders that key players are known inside as the \"Michigan Mafia&com;\" stood solid in opposition&com; as did most of the huge Texas delegation. California formally supported the merger&com; but many California delegates reported to me that they would vote to reject. One president said to Weaver&com; just before the vote&com; \"I have several hundred delegates here. I have been telling them to think for themselves for years. Now you want me to muscle them--overnight?\" Leadership actions following the rejection would indicate they were more than surprised. Perhaps they believed they had prepared for so long that nothing could truly go awry.&nl;&nl;     35. NEA president Bob Chase&com; who has distinguished himself in his fervent support for gay and lesbian rights inside the NEA&com; was on the merger hunt for quite some time&com; as were many other top NEA officials. Indeed&com; the AFT has almost always been ready to talk merger. NEA claims a merger with the AFT in New York was sabotaged by federation efforts to simply subsume the NEA membership in the late 1960's. A similar scenario followed in Florida in the early 1970's. In 1973 and again in 1993&com; NEA delegates passed New Business Items insisting that any discussions with the AFT had to take place on the grounds that there would be:&nl;&nl;    No affiliation with the AFL-CIO.&nl;    Guaranteed minority group representation.&nl;    Guarantees of secret balloting.&nl;&nl;     36. The 1993 NBI included language that promised any united organization could take positions on questions \"that are in the best interests of our members.\" This indicates well-founded fears that the private sector domination within the AFL-CIO would cause divisions over raising and distributing public funds. The members wanted to be able to lobby for taxes for public school--above potential AFSCME member claims for mental health expenditures&com; for example&com; or cries for tax cuts from the Carpenters Union. The 2.3 million members of the NEA wanted to be sure that their voice would be loud.  &nl;http://clogic.eserver.org/2-1/gibson.html  &nl;''Teachers Unions and the War Within&nl;&com; Making sense of the conflict''  &nl;http://educationnext.org/teachers-unions-war-within/  &nl;None of the butthurt ever go to teachers union webpages to SEE with the EYES&com; what is REALLY happening.  &nl;SEEING is not rumor filled assumption.  &nl;Ask yourself how many details you know for sure about what the NEA/AFT&com; biggest union in the world merger means&com; and why they are all voted in to supporting Common Core&com; like a monopoly that ignores parental input. &nl;\n"

      "Figured I'd see a rant like this on Black Lives Matter or Mizzou or something else of equal uselessness. This sub just brings to light the atrocities police inflict on a daily basis. Would you like if a cop tossed a grenade into your toddlers crib and scarred him for life only to have them says its the kids fault for not moving? Or how about one of the most recent ones where the father of 3 told the cops they can't come in without a warrant and they proceeded to kick the door in and kill him? &nl;&nl;I'm not a college kid as you so put it. I'm a father of two and pull in almost 6 figures a year in property management. I go to work and I go home. Problem is in the period of the 2 hours a day I'm in the car I've been pulled over quite a few times. Now I'm not the perfect driver ofcourse&com; no one is&com; but a cop was going the opposite direction of me in the middle of the night and had no lights on at all. I gave him a quick flash to let him know and sure enough the lights come on and he flips a bitch to pull me over. Just last week there were 6 or so cops sitting at the corner of my street hiding in the bushes and pulling over every car going just over the speed limit. Now here's the problem my corner is on the bottom of a bridge so without slamming your brakes gravity alone speeds you up a little. I watched as they pulled over at least 10 cars within an hour before they decided to pack up and move on. Its all about how much money they can extort from you and how much control they believe they have.&nl;&nl;If you sit there and believe the police are innocent you must be the college kid. And now don't get me completely wrong. I don't believe every single cop is bad. But the good ones sure don't speak up when they should.  \n",

      "You and the other guy are getting downvoted for saying it but I do think it's true. There's a distinct narrative in the mainstream media that minorities are specifically being targeted for these violent assaults and murders when I think it's pretty clear that that's not always the case. Many of the people who are fighting for the reform of this kind of thing are unwilling to acknowledge that is isn't always racially motivated. It confuses the narrative.

They've presented this \"war on police\" narrative to excuse their behavior. It isn't happening. What's happening is that the police are being caught victimizing people on camera and obviously officers aren't happy with it. &nl;&nl;Don't act like this case wasn't lauded by those who claim that LEOs are being unfairly targeted because that's just not true. Since the truth has come out I've even seen law enforcement lamenting on their public support for this guy and the narrative that police are increasingly being targeted because of their low popularity.

      "But they *did* use black lives matter as a pretense to cover their crimes. &nl;&nl;You're missing the point. They used the current political climate and law enforcement sentiment to cover their crimes. Law enforcement agencies&com; unions&com; and the media completely bought their stories and continued with the false narrative that LEOs were being targeted around the country. People still believe that garbage even though this has been the second safest year for police officers since records were first maintained. &nl;&nl;What are you trying to do here? The LEOs involved indisputably used these events as an opportunity to cover their crimes. The fact that they personally benefited from these crimes doesn't change what they did. They were playing to the false narrative that LEOs were being targeted by anti-police groups. That never happened. \n",

The stories where twisted by others to be against BLM. &nl;&nl;&gt;I don't support those douches&com; but saying they all did it to instigate more suspicion towards BLM is incorrect.  &nl;&nl;But the end effect was the same. It created this false narrative that LEOs were being targeted around the country and it's an outright lie to deny that police departments spun it that way. So the title isn't misleading. Numerous police forces around the country used these cases to lie to the American public. \n",

      "Agreed. I live near the Glinowiecz thing&com; he had apparently been stealing from the Police Explorer program for like seven years. They are investigating his wife and oldest son. &nl;&nl;He said on the police radio that he was pursuing three males&com; two black and one white in a remote area by an abandoned factory or plant surrounded by lakes and shit. Fucker offed himself as a last attempt to shield his family and maybe keep the money&com; I don't know. The police investigation looked like it was headed that way if the coroner didn't release info to the press too. Everyone wants to avoid a scandal and this guy figuratively fell on his sword.
